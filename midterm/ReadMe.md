### Introduction
Access to quality education is a fundamental right, and governments worldwide strive to ensure every child's enrollment and completion of their schooling. However, dropout rates in schools remain a persistent challenge, often influenced by various social, economic, and demographic factors. In an effort to address this issue, the Government of Gujarat has recognized the need for a comprehensive analysis of dropout patterns at the school level. By understanding the underlying causes and identifying vulnerable groups, the government aims to formulate targeted interventions that can significantly reduce dropout rates.

### Problem Statement
Create a prediction model using past data and student information that can reliably anticipate student retention and dropout rates for the next academic term. The aim is to find students who are at risk of leaving school or not enrolling again, and providing educational institutions with useful information to help them put effective retention policies in place.

### Data description
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. 

Values provided in the data has already been encoded to categorial data. Meaning of the categorial values in the dataset is explained in this paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/11/146 (Appendix A section)
